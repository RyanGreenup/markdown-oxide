# Markdown Oxide

Markdown Oxide is attempting to be the best Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system for software enthusiasts - people like me who (in addition to note-taking) are addicted to creating the best text editing experience. **Bring your own text editor and let `markdown-oxide` be your PKM!**

Obsidian strongly inspires Markdown Oxide's PKM features - in fact, Markdown Oxide is fully compatible with your Obsidian vault. Markdown Oxide does not aim to fully replace Obsidian; it serves to provide a feature-rich and advanced note-taking experience. Obsidian remains a terrific front-end for your linked markdown notes. Also, in terms of features, Markdown Oxide and Obsidian are quite alligned.

Markdown Oxide's features are implemented in the form of a language server aiming to be fully compatible with your favorite text editor and its ecosystem. Read on to learn what Markdown Oxide provides and how to install and configure it.
