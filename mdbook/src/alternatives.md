# Alternatives

- https://github.com/gw31415/obsidian-lsp: I have been in discussions with the author; The author doesn't have time to maintain the project. Also, I, of course, love the idea, but the current LS doesn't provide many obsidian-specific features yet.
- https://github.com/WhiskeyJack96/logseqlsp: This is a cool project and a great inspiration for Logseq support (which is upcoming). status: it doesn't seem that it is maintained and it (obviously) does not provide support for all of the obsidian syntax
- The og https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman: I used this for a while, but it is not obsidian specific and didn't act well with my vault. Additionally, the block completions in markdown-oxide allow for a fuzzy/grep search of the entire vault to generate the completions; I don't think Markman has any features like this; (this is a feature that Logseq signified for PKM; the concept that *anything is linkable* is quite powerful)
