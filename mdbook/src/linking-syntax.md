# Linking Syntax

The linking syntax is that of Obsidian's and can be found here https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links

Generally, this is `[[relativeFilePath(#heading)?(|display text)?]]` e.g. [[articles/markdown oxide#Features|Markdown Oxide Features]] to link to a heading in `Markdown Oxide.md` file in the `articles` folder or [[Obsidian]] for the `Obsidian.md` file in the root folder. Markdown oxide also supports markdown links
